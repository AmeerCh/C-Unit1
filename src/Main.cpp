/*
Note:
Goal is to understand 
- how functions work with different type of inputs.
- how binary operators work.
- 

Actions:
1. You need to fill in the blanks in files(lessons) under spec project.
- L01_FunctionsSpec.cpp 
- L02_BitwiseSpec.cpp

2. You need to implement the function stubs these files(exercises).
- E01_Functions.cpp
- E02_Bitwise.cpp
